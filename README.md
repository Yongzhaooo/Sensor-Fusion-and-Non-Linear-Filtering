# Sensor Fusion and Non-Linear Filtering
Course at Chalmers University of Technology

---
## Overview of core content

Lars taught the knowledge of multi-sensor fusion in a comprehensive and straightforward manner from a high-level perspective. 

This repository includes my homework and the smartphone project, a piece of work I am proud of and consider to be one of the best in the class.

Upload them basically for searching master thesis (well, I guess HR won't check them anyway)

## Warning

DON'T NOT copy the use the codes directly!

There are some minor mistakes I haven't fixed (Fixed in discussion and in report, so, I can say I surely mastered every part of the course)

If you plagiarize, you will gain nothing and only face judgment in an academic court.
