\section{Understanding the conditional density}
\subsection{a}
No way, for we don't know the distribution of $ x $ only know it is a random variable.

If we know it is a norm distribution or kind of we can.

\subsection{b}

Now given x, then the information of x is deterministic, not the unknown distribution, is just a certain value. Then with r, we can determin $ p(y|r) $ is a Gaussian distribution, mean is $h(x)$ and cov is $ \sigma^2_r $

\subsection{c}

The same with a, x is uncertain, so cannot discribe $ p(y) $
